# Description of dataset:
Our dataset provides data regarding car accidents in Maryland, specifically Montgomery County. Our group found the dataset with the website provided (https://data.gov/). The dataset contains many rows and columns containing various data types, with main characteristics being in columns. It specifies information regarding the collision type, street name, weather and light conditions, vehicle type, and the damage extent. These dimensions are all data type string. The data set also contains dimensions such as crash date/time, 
It specifies information such as the collision type, the location of the accident, the weather, time of day, injuries, and the damage extent. 

# Question 1:
### Q1: When conditions are clear, what time of day do most vehicle accidents occur when a cell phone was the reason behind the distracted driver? For those times, what percentage of total crashes reported were caused by a cell phone related distracted driver?


### Importance:

# Question 2:
### Q2: The dataset displays the driver and car information for the person at fault. Which types of cars are correlated with which types of accidents? How many of each accident type are there, and what is the average speed limit for each type?

### Importance:

# Manipulation applied to the data set for analysis:
There were two manipulations we decided to perform on the data set to allow easier access to the information that was critical for our analysis. In the exported data set, the date and time of the accident were listed in one column. We decided it would be best to separate the date and time column, essentially making each their own individual columns. Additionally, we had to alter the time column. The time column was changed to display time by the hour. With this manipulation, we were able to analyze crashes that occurred at different hours. We also had to filter the data to only display clear conditions and distractions related to a cell phone only to analyze the first question. Without this manipulation we would have a much larger dataset and unnecessary information would be displayed.
